# SpellSetu

SpellSetu is a robust bilingual text correction system designed for both English and Hindi. It identifies and fixes spelling errors and improper word usage using a hybrid approach. First, it generates correction candidates via dictionary lookups employing Jaro-Winkler similarity metrics. Then, it re-ranks these candidates based on context using the pre‑trained XLM‑Roberta model. This combination ensures accurate and context-aware corrections for multilingual text.

## Problem Statement

SpellSetu addresses the challenge of correcting spelling mistakes and inappropriate word usage in bilingual contexts (English and Hindi). Many existing solutions focus on only one language or do not incorporate context into their corrections, leading to suboptimal results.

## Key Features

- **Bilingual Correction:** Supports both English and Hindi.
- **Dictionary-based Corrections:** Uses SCOWL for English and a custom Hindi wordlist.
- **Contextual Re-ranking:** Leverages XLM‑Roberta to select the best correction based on context.
- **Synthetic Data Evaluation:** Generates synthetic error–correct pairs for performance evaluation.
- **Optional Fine-Tuning:** Allows the model to be fine‑tuned on your Hindi wordlist for enhanced performance.
